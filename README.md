# DeathZoneDisablerinator 3000  
**Ahahahaha! BEHOLD! The DeathZoneDisablerinator 3000! A VERY advanced plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that disables those annoying death zonesâ€”because who needs zones of instant doom telling you what to do?! Not on MY watch!**

---

## ðŸ›  Features  

- **DISABLES DEATH ZONES!** (Yes, the name says it all.)  
- Lightweight, effective, and ridiculously EVILâ€”just the way I like it!  
- Configurable, because not all evil plans should be one-size-fits-all!  

---

## ðŸš€ Installation  

1. **Download the Plugin**  
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/YourUsername/DeathZoneDisablerinator/releases) page and grab the latest version.  

2. **Drop It Into Your Server**  
   - Take the `.dll` file and place it lovingly (or evilly) into the `Plugins` folder of your SCP: Secret Laboratory server.  

3. **Restart Your Server**  
   - Yes, turn it off and back on againâ€”just like every tech support call ever.  

4. **Configure Like a Genius**  
   - Check the `config` file that after the first run. (See below for details!)

## ðŸ”§ Configuration  

The `config` file gives you TOTAL control (evil laugh)! Hereâ€™s what you can tweak:
